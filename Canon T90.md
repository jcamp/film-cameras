Facts:

* introduced in 1986
* last professional-level manual-focus camera from Canon
* uses the [Canon FD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_FD "Canon FD") [lens mount](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_mount "Lens mount")
* T90 was nicknamed "the tank" by Japanese [photojournalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photojournalist "Photojournalist")
* Designed by German [industrial designer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_designer "Industrial designer") [Luigi Colani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Colani "Luigi Colani") in a collaboration with Canon's own designers
* T90 introduced features still used on SLR cameras today
* T90 includes an integral [motor driven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_drive "Motor drive") film advance
* [focal plane shutter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_plane_shutter "Focal plane shutter"), mirror and aperture cocking and rewind functions
* T90 has three coreless micromotors
* 4.5 frames per second continuous mode
* four [AA batteries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AA_batteries "AA batteries") in the base of the camera
* T90 uses a dual [CPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit "Central processing unit") architecture
* The main, low-power CPU runs at 32 kHz while the sub-CPU runs at 1 MHz, and is powered down when not needed
* A coin-type [lithium battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_battery "Lithium battery") on the main circuit board retains camera settings when the AA batteries are removed. (Expected battery life is on the order of five years)
* T90, Canon developed their most sophisticated [light-metering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_meter "Light meter") system yet
* [center-weighted average metering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center-weighted_average_metering "Center-weighted average metering"), [partial area metering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_area_metering "Partial area metering"), and [spot metering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spot_metering "Spot metering")
* partial area metering uses the center 13% of the picture area, while spot metering uses the center 2.7%
* _Multi-spot metering_ allows the photographer to average up to eight spot meter readings from different parts of the scene
* _Highlight_ and _Shadow_ spot readings could be taken
* Center-weighted and partial area metering are performed by a double-area silicon [photocell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photocell "Photocell") (SPC) in Canon's standard location above the eyepiece
* spot metering is performed by another SPC located at the bottom of the mirror box
* Eight [exposure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_(photography) "Exposure (photography)") modes are available
	* Program AE (Auto-Exposure)
	* Variable Shift Program AE
	* Aperture Priority AE and 
	* Shutter-Speed Priority AE
	* Manual mode is available
	* Flash AE mode is available for flash photography
* Safety Shift feature allows the camera to adjust the "fixed" parameter if it can not obtain a correct exposure otherwise.
* T90 was the first Canon camera to support [through-the-lens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through-the-lens "Through-the-lens") (TTL) [flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_(photography) "Flash (photography)") metering
	* This system is also used on Canon's new EOS system, making the T90 the only non-EOS Canon body compatible with TTL Canon flashes
	* T90's [X-sync](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-sync "X-sync") speed of 1/250 second was the fastest Canon had achieved
	* dedicated flash unit, the Speedlite 300TL
* the [focusing screen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focusing_screen "Focusing screen") is interchangeable - eight different screens are available for different applications
* Two optional data backs are available for the T90
* A wired 60T3 remote control unit plugs into a socket fitted beneath the right handgrip
* A [infrared remote control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_remote_control "Infrared remote control") kit is also available as the LC-2

Canon ceased supporting the camera in 1998.

Problems:

One problem concerns the shutter. The T90's shutter appears to become "sticky" as the camera ages. It is prone to locking up, in which case the camera's LCD displays "EEE" and the message "HELP" appears in the viewfinder display. This is commonly called the "EEE syndrome" among users. The problem is most likely to crop up after the camera has been left unused for some time; thus, the best way to prevent it is regular use of the camera. It does not seem to cause inaccurate shutter speeds before failure. The problem can be corrected by a knowledgeable technician without replacing the shutter mechanism. It is reportedly caused by dirt on the shutter's magnets affecting their performance. But if left unused for an extended period of time the circuit will need to be replaced, an expensive and time-consuming proposition.

The [sticky shutter problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_100#Use_today "Canon EOS 100") relates to a rubber washer that is involved in the operation of the shutter. With age and atmospheric conditions, it tends to deteriorate and become sticky, so that it impedes the operation of the shutter. Frequent use can delay the stickiness from 'glueing up' the shutter, but once started, the only long-term remedy is to have the shutter repaired, when the rubber washer is replaced, and so another 10 years or more can be enjoyed with the camera working correctly. A good short-term solution is to lightly clean the shutter diaphragm with a cotton ball and lighter fluid.

Canon FD lenses, however, remain quite affordable compared to their EF counterparts
